Version: 0.1

Capture and record any audio output that comes through the soundcard. Requires ALSA.
Please refer to the website of the project for more details.

Usage:

./01-verify.py
    Verify your current settings. It is a good idea to write down
    these settings to know what to restore later.
    You can edit 03-Skype-restore-rec-to-microphone.py and specify
    these values.

./02-set-for-rec-soundcard-output.py
    Change settings for recording soundcard output.
    Default values: 'Mix', 'on', and 3. You might want to 
    change these values in the source.

./04-start-rec-soundcard-output.py
    Start recording. The script will ask the name of the
    output file. If you press ENTER, the script will generate
    a unique name. By default, the output will be stored in the 
    "output" folder.

./03-Skype-restore-rec-to-microphone.py
    Restore settings for recording the microphone. Edit the
    source and set those values that you wrote down at the
    beginning.
